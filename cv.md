# **_Kristina Klepik_**

_Junior Frontend Developer_

## _About_

I started to learn web development last year. It was an informed choice to change my profession, so I am very motivated to develop my career. I've become interested in Frontend development because I can immediately see the result of my work. Also there are many ways to create a product and you can always do better.
Now I'm practicing Frontend with RS School and taking English lessons. As for interests, in my free time I enjoy sports.
